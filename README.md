# Welcome


## Purpose and target audience

The Together Cycling website is an online space designed to unite cyclists in the Stockholm (Sweden) area, offering a resource for peloton rides. This site aims to serve the specific needs of individual cyclists who may not be affiliated with any particular cycling club.

The primary objective is to provide regularly updated group training opportunities/peloton rides in the Stockholm area with different starting points and focus. It is a centralized location where you can discover upcoming rides with information on date, time and rides specifics. In addition to this, the aim is also to provide a source of inspiration with a collection of curated maps offering rides suggestions for individual solo rides.

### User stories

- As the organizer, I want to establish a cycling community where riders can connect, share their cycling experiences and enjoy group rides together.

- As an experienced cyclist, I need easily accessible information on upcoming ton rides in my area, which will enable me to join rides that suit my training goals and skill level.

- As an experienced cyclist, I seek an online source that provides a variety of inspiring routes and rides that help me stay motivated and continously challenge myself.

- As a cyclist new to peloton riding, I'm eager to learn the ropes of riding in a group and need resources and guidance that help me ride safely and confidently in a peloton.

- As a prospective member considering joining the group, I want to learn more about the individuals behind this cycling community. Understanding their vision will help me evaluate if it aligns with my interests.

The Ride with us page contains a form to sign-up for a newsletter with information on scheduled rides and other updates.

## Technologies

**HTML, CSS**
- GitHub for storing repository
- Codeanywhere for code editing

**Imagery**
*Photoshop to convert images to webP files, and resizing.

**Content**
- Font Awesome: to generate icons used on the page.
- Favicon generator: to generate the fav icon on the tab next to the title.
- Google Fonts: to find the fonts used on the page and to get the code to embed on the page.
- Google maps/My maps: to generate the rides shared on the rides page.

## Accessibility

In order to ensure accessibility for all users, irrespective of their internet connection speed or potential disabilities, the below things have been implemented in the code and design of the web page.

* Structural Elements: I've employed the use of semantic HTML elements such as <header>, <main>, <footer>, and <section> to help organize the content and improve the overall accessibility of the page.

* Alternative Text and ARIA Labels: Throughout the website, I've incorporated descriptive alt-text for images and used ARIA labels to facilitate screen reading, to make the site available for users with visual impairments so they can understand the content and functionality of images and other interactive elements.

Image Optimization: To enhance site performance and accommodate users on slow internet connections, I've converted images to the WebP format, which offers better compression without sacrificing quality. Additionally, I've resized images to their smallest possible dimensions while maintaining their visual integrity. This improves page load times without compromising content quality.

**Rides page:**
Had issues with the width and height attributes for the iframes, that were initially set to 100%. This had to be change to a numeric value and that caused some errors on the display of the elements. A new media query for smaller screens had to be added to accommodate the display on screens less than 380px.
