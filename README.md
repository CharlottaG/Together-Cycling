## Purpose and target audience

The Together Cycling website is an online space designed to unite cyclists in the Stockholm (Sweden) area, offering a resource for peloton rides. This site aims to serve the specific needs of individual cyclists who may not be affiliated with any particular cycling club.

The primary objective is to provide regularly updated group training opportunities/peloton rides in the Stockholm area with different starting points and focus. It is a centralized location where you can discover upcoming rides with information on date, time and rides specifics. In addition to this, the aim is also to provide a source of inspiration with a collection of curated maps offering rides suggestions for individual solo rides.

### User stories

- **As the organizer**, I want to establish a cycling community where riders can connect, share their cycling experiences and enjoy group rides together.

- **As an experienced cyclist**, I need easily accessible information on upcoming ton rides in my area, which will enable me to join rides that suit my training goals and skill level.

- **As an experienced cyclist**, I seek an online source that provides a variety of inspiring routes and rides that help me stay motivated and continously challenge myself.

- **As a cyclist new to peloton riding**, I'm eager to learn the ropes of riding in a group and need resources and guidance that help me ride safely and confidently in a peloton.

- **As a prospective member considering joining the group**, I want to learn more about the individuals behind this cycling community. Understanding their vision will help me evaluate if it aligns with my interests.

### Imagery

Each of the three pages have a different background image, these were downloaded from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) a free stock image site with high-quality photos. For a more dramatic and consequential look a color gradient overlay with #312539 (dark lilac) to #BA567B (greyish pink) has been applied to all. The two colors was picked from the siteâ€™s color scheme.

#### Our Rides page

The Our Rides page provides information on scheduled rides information on when and where the group rides will take place, what type of ride it is and some information on the focus of the ride so that the user can assess wheather that specific ride is for them or not. The page also provides map to show the route if the user is just out to find inspiration on new rides. The maps are interactive and can be viewed in a larger format by clicking the top right icon in the black bar on top of the map, the maps can also be shared with others from the black top bar.

#### Ride with us page

The Ride with us page contains a form to sign-up for a newsletter with information on scheduled rides and other updates. Together with the sign-up form there is information on the intent with the newsletter for the user to know what they are signing up for (or not). The sign-up form have three required fields to get the basic information about the user, and requires you to fill in an email address in order to submit the form. In the future this could potentially become a members page with a login to add personal information that can be used to present members the same way as the site owners (home page) and connect with eachother.

*For UX reasons* the order of the content will change depending on if the page is viewed using a mobile or a tablet/laptop. On mobiles the sign-up form is prioritized as the most important content while at larger screens where you can overview all content at the same time, the user is presented with the intent information first.

## Bug fixes

The content on the Our rides page did not flow as intended, but this was fixed by using the flexbox feature.To be able to adjust the misalignment of the content of the different rides, and to be able to control the responsivity I changed the top container (containing all the rides in one box) to have the display property of flexbox. This solved the issue as I could set the flex-direction to row and let the content wrap to fit the screen size.

## Technologies

### HTML and CSS

- GitHub for storing repository
- Codeanywhere for code editing

### Imagery

- Photoshop to convert images to webP files, and resizing.

### Content

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/start): to generate icons used on the page.
- [Favicon generator](https://favicon.io/): to generate the fav icon on the tab next to the title.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/): to find the fonts used on the page and to get the code to embed on the page.
- [Google maps/My maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/): to generate the rides shared on the rides page.

## Accessibility

In order to ensure accessibility for all users, irrespective of their internet connection speed or potential disabilities, the below things have been implemented in the code and design of the web page.

- Structural Elements: I've employed the use of semantic HTML elements such as *header*, *main*, *footer*, and *section* to help organize the content and improve the overall accessibility of the page.

- Alternative Text and ARIA Labels: Throughout the website, I've incorporated descriptive alt-text for images and used ARIA labels to facilitate screen reading, to make the site available for users with visual impairments so they can understand the content and functionality of images and other interactive elements.

Image Optimization: To enhance site performance and accommodate users on slow internet connections, I've converted images to the WebP format, which offers better compression without sacrificing quality. Additionally, I've resized images to their smallest possible dimensions while maintaining their visual integrity. This improves page load times without compromising content quality.

## Deployment

The Together Cycling site was deployed to [GitHub](https://github.com) pages, following these steps:

1. Go to the [Together-Cycling repository](https://github.com/CharlottaG/Together-Cycling)
2. Go to the *Settings* tab (top left in the menu)
3. Go to the left-hand section,under *Code and automation* click **Pages**.
4. Go to *Source* under *Build and deployment* and use the dropdown menu to choose **Deploy from a branch**
5. Under *Branch* use the dropdown menu to select **main** and set the *folder* to **root**.

### Validation

#### Home page

There was an incorrect use of an aria-label attribute with a link, when that was corrected and two open tags were close the paged passed the validation.

<https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://charlottag.github.io/Together-Cycling/>

#### Rides page

Had issues with the width and height attributes for the iframes, that were initially set to 100%. This had to be change to a numeric value and that caused some errors on the display of the elements. A new media query for smaller screens had to be added to accommodate the display on screens less than 380px.

### Content

The web site copy is my own, but I used [openai](https://openai.com) to add some more flavor and improve it, enhancing its overall quality and engagement.

### Media

- [Rawpixel](https://www.rawpixel.com) was used to find a fav-icon for the tab.
- [Favicon converter](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/) was used to generate the different files supported by different browsers.
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)was used to find all other imagery, and Photoshop was used to convert the jpg files to webp files.
- [Colormind](http://colormind.io/bootstrap>) was used to find a color palette with colors for text, headings, background colors and overlays to use on the site.
