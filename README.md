## User stories
 - As the organizer I want to start a community of riders to share
   experiences and have fun together.
   
 - As an experienced cyclist I want information on upcoming peleton
   rides so I can join and get the training I need.
      
 - As an experienced cyclist I'm looking for inspiration on new rides to stay motivated and challenge myself.
      
 - As a “new to peleton”-cyclist I want to learn how to ride in a   
   peleton so I can join safely and with confident.

 - As a cyclist thinking of joining I want to know who is behind this   
   group so I can evaluate if it is something I’m interested in.
